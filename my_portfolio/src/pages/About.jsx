            <h2>Hello, I'm Utsav Rai</h2>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m a passionate Computer Science with AI student, driven by curiosity to understand how technology and intelligence come together to shape the world. What began as an interest in problem-solving and technology has grown into a journey of learning programming, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data-driven innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy working with tools like Python, Pandas, and machine learning libraries, while constantly exploring new concepts in computer science and AI. Beyond coding, I spend time learning from research, experimenting with projects, and keeping up with the latest trends in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              My goal is to apply computer science and AI to create solutions that make a real impact. I believe in continuous learning, critical thinking, and building projects that are not only innovative but also practical and meaningful.
